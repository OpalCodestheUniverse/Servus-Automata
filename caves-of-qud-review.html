            <h1>Caves of Qud: A Science Fantasy Roguelike Epic</h1>

            <p>“There’s a sense of magnificent history to dredge from its depths.” — Kill Screen</p>
            <p>“Caves of Qud is one of the best roguelikes in years, packed with evocative prose and featuring a captivating world of arcane secrets to explore.” — Kotaku</p>
            <p>“Narratively, this is one of the most compelling game stories that I’ve seen in a long time.” — Polygon</p>

            <h2>About This Game</h2>
            <p><strong>Caves of Qud</strong> is a science fantasy roguelike epic steeped in retrofuturism, deep simulation, and swathes of sentient plants. Come inhabit a living, breathing world and chisel through layers of thousand-year-old civilizations. Decide: is it a dying earth, or is it on the verge of rebirth?</p>

            <h2>Deep Simulation and Rich Worldbuilding</h2>
            <p>Do anything and everything. Caves of Qud is a deeply simulated, biologically diverse, richly cultured world.</p>

            <ul class="left-padding">
                <li><strong>Deep Physical Simulation:</strong> Don’t like the wall blocking your way? Dig through it with a pickaxe, or eat through it with your corrosive gas mutation, or melt it to lava. Yes, every wall has a melting point.</li>
                <li><strong>Fully Simulated Creatures:</strong> Every monster and NPC is as fully simulated as the player. That means they have levels, skills, equipment, faction allegiances, and body parts. So if you have a mutation that lets you, say, psionically dominate a spider, you can traipse through the world as a spider, laying webs and eating things.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Faction System:</strong> Pursue allegiances with over 70 factions: apes, crabs, trees, robots, and highly entropic beings, just to name a few.</li>
                <li><strong>Richly Detailed Science Fantasy Setting:</strong> Over fifteen years of worldbuilding have led to a rich, weird, labyrinthine, one-of-a-kind storyworld, layered on top of the simulation, all for you to explore. Live and drink, friend.</li>
                <li><strong>Tactical Gameplay:</strong> Turn-based, sandbox exploration and combat offers as many solutions as you and your mutations, implants, artifacts, and skills are creative enough to invent.</li>
                <li><strong>RPG Elements:</strong> Quests, NPCs, villages, historic sites; some dynamic and some handwritten, interwoven to produce a transportative RPG experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Atmospheric Original Soundtrack:</strong> Over two hours of otherworldly music to delve to.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Expressive Character Creation</h2>
            <p>Caves of Qud has one of the most expressive character creators of all time. Play the role of a mutant indigenous to the salt-spangled dunes and jungles of Qud, or play a true kin descendant from one of the few remaining eco-domes — the toxic arboreta of Ekuemekiyye, the ice-sheathed arcology of Ibul, or the crustal mortars of Yawningmoon.</p>

            <ul class="left-padding">
                <li>Over 70 mutations — outfit yourself with wings, two heads, four arms, flaming hands, teleportation, the power to clone yourself…</li>
                <li>Dozens of cybernetic implants (and more to find as treasure) — night vision, translucent skin, carbide fists, spring-loaded ankle tendons…</li>
                <li>24 castes and kits from across the social order of Qud and beyond Moghra’yi, the Great Salt Desert</li>
                <li>Too overwhelmed to build a character from scratch? Choose one of 9 preset characters and start your adventure right away. Then return to character creation when you are ready.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Multiple Play Modes</h2>
            <p>Play one of four modes:</p>
            <ul class="left-padding">
                <li><strong>Classic:</strong> Like other traditional roguelikes, this mode has permadeath, meaning you lose your character when you die. Extremely challenging even for experts.</li>
                <li><strong>Roleplay:</strong> Play it like an RPG. Save your progress at checkpoints located in settlements.</li>
                <li><strong>Wander:</strong> Focus on exploration. Most creatures will not attack you, you don’t gain experience by killing, but you do gain experience by discovering new locations and treating with legendary creatures.</li>
                <li><strong>Daily:</strong> One chance with a fixed character and world seed. How long will you survive?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>In Development</h2>
            <p>The game is nearly complete, and there are already hundreds of hours worth of gameplay here. But before 1.0, we’ll also be adding:</p>
            <ul class="left-padding">
                <li>The last leg of the main quest</li>
                <li>The new, fully graphical UI</li>
                <li>Hundreds of visual & sound effects</li>
                <li>Lots of polish & stability</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>An Epic Project</h2>
            <p>Caves of Qud is a project of epic proportions that's been in development for over fifteen years, since 2007. It began as the science fantasy roguelike dream of co-creators Jason Grinblat and Brian Bucklew, who released the first beta in 2010. Since then, it's accrued a few more contributors who have enriched the project by helping to add visual effects, sound effects, an original soundtrack, a new UI, new game systems, new lore, and half a world of content. Caves of Qud has grown into a wild garden of emergent narrative, where a handwritten story weaves a path through rich physical, social, and historical simulations. The result is a hybrid handcrafted and procedurally-generated world that's alive in a way few games are.</p>
