        Live and drink, Elden Ring Discord member or otherwise. If you're here, you were either interested in the link in my discord profile, or you were banned and someone pointed you here. Either way, welcome. Feel free to either head to the ban appeals section and read up, browse the recipes or blog posts section, or just listen to the background music I picked out for the landing page. Either way, your thirst is mine, my water is yours. Live and drink. Also, hi mom, look I'm a programmer!
